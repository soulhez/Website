      <br>Amara, Fred and Ethan winners of the Children in Need tech challenge recieving their prizes kindly donated by Mazars and Wragge &amp; Co.
      <p>"WhackaCake" is being built by volunteers from the UK tech community as part of the "Children in Need Tech Challenge" hosted at The Oxygen Accelerator in Birmingham.</p>
      
      <p>600 schoolchildren in the Birmingham area were asked to come up with a game idea and the characters that they saw being part of it. The best entries were shortlisted and asked to come to Oxygen and face a "Dragons Den" panel of game developers, designers and local businessmen.</p>
      
      <p>After pitches from the children, that would put most entrepreneurs to shame, a joint decision was reached where two ideas were melded together to create "Whack a Cake". Combining the gameplay of 70s carnival classic Whac-a-Mole with 80s board game staple Build a Better Burger<strong> "Whack a Cake"</strong> is a new game that will have gamers hitting characters to get the right ingredients to build the best cake possible -the better the cake the more it is worth!!!</p>
      
      <p>"Whack a Cake" is being built at <a href="http://www.oxygenaccelerator.com" title="Oxygen Accelerator">www.oxygenaccelerator.com</a> over the  48 hours between 18:00 the 11-13th of November. Volunteers have given up their weekends to come and do something great for "Children in Need" as part of the "Children in Need Tech Challenge".
Designed and built in 48 hours by a crack team of volunteers from tech startups across the UK "Whack a Cake" will launch on Sunday 13th November.</p>

<p>Go to “How it was Built” to see more pictures of Pudsey, the kids who applied as well as the designers, coders and game developers who made it all happen in just 48 hours!</p>
