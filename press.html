      <p><strong>A 48 hour tech challenge for Children in Need</strong></p>
      <img style="width: 640px; height: 300px; margin-top: 20px;" src="http://static.whackacake.com/images/press.jpg">

<p>This weekend a crack team of tech volunteers have donated their time to create an online and mobile game in just 48 hrs.</p>

<p>The game is the result of a competition involving over 600  primary school children.  who were all inspired to take part in the challenge. Boys and girls aged between 7 and 11  turned up armed with sketches of characters and plots they wanted to see come to life. The winning concept was taken from entries by Amara (7) from Blue Coats School and Ethan and Fred (both 11) St Francis CoE Primary School and 'Whackacake' was born. The finished game will be available for purchase on  initially through The Android Market, The Chrome Webstore and Openappmkt with Apple App Store approval expected in the next week or so, with all proceeds being donated to Children in Need.</p>

<p>The game itself, Whack-a-Cake [link to download], is a completely addictive new game in which the player collects ingredients to build their cake. Each game lasts about 1 minute , the more 'good' ingredients, such as flour, eggs, chocolate you collect the more points you will get, although collecting bad ingredients, such as Chilli, Brussel Sprouts and mushrooms, will result in you losing points. . Each cake has 8 layers and the more cakes you complete the bigger your score will be at the end.</p>

<p>Whack-a-Cake is intended to be played by people of all ages, specifically people with an interest in charity and casual games and will be available on all platforms capable of supporting a web browser.</p>

<p>The project took place throughout the course of the weekend at Birmingham Science Park Aston and was organised by Oxygen Accelerator, an investment programme designed to intensively mentor super-early stage startups in a 13-week long program. All the teams currently participating in the programme diligently spent their weekend coding away for the cause.</p>

<p>Said Oxygen Accelerator founder Mark Hales, “This game jam is about inspiring the young designers and developers of the future, while raising money for a hugely worthwhile cause. Thanks must go to our fantastic teams for all of their work, and we hope everyone loves the game as much as we have loved creating it.”</p>

<p><strong>Tech Press Release</strong></p>

<p>48 hour Game Jam for Children in Need</p>

<p>This weekend a crack team of tech volunteers have donated their time to create an online and mobile game in just 48 hrs.</p>

<p>In just 48 hours, a mobile and online game has been created all proceeds of which will go towards Children in Need. 600 children entered ideas, the winning concept was chosen on Friday 11th of November and 48 hours of non-stop development later, the game Whackacake' was born. The finished game will be available for purchase initially through The Android Market, The Chrome Webstore and Openappmkt with Apple App Store approval expected in the next week or so.</p>

<p>The development team was lead by Adam Russell of “Soshi Games” [link], consisting of 11 developers, 3 designers and 8 content producers, and they took the game from concept right through to addictive playability in just 48 hours! The team have created every part of the game from the characters, the game engine and interfaces to gameplay features. It was a gruelling 48 hours with 140 cups of coffee, 53 beers, 4 takeaways and 1 shiny new game for Children in Need.</p>

<p>Whack-a-Cake [link to download] is an addictive new game in which the player collects ingredients to build their cake. It is a casual browser-based score attack game, similar to the whack-a-mole style game on Little Deviants. The more 'good' ingredients you collect the more points you will get, although collecting bad ingredients will result in you losing points. Each game lasts about 1 minute and the more 'good' ingredients you collect in that time the better your cake will be. Each cake has 8 layers and the more cakes you complete the bigger your score will be at the end.</p>

<p>The project took place throughout the course of the weekend at Birmingham Science Park Aston and was organised by Oxygen Accelerator, an investment programme designed to intensively mentor super-early stage startups in a 13-week long program. All the teams currently participating in the programme diligently spent their weekend coding away for the cause.</p>

<p>The teams were keen to show that being an entrepreneur is as much about helping the community as it is about striving to own ones own island a la Richard Branson. This weekend, with just 15 days to go to Investor Days, all of the teams on the Oxygen Accelerator gave back by donating their time to the “Children in Need 48 Hour Tech Challenge”.</p>

<p>Said Oxygen Accelerator founder Mark Hales, “This game jam is about inspiring the young designers and developers of the future, while raising money for a hugely worthwhile cause.</p>

<p>Thanks must go to our fantastic teams for all of their work, and we hope everyone loves the game as much as we have loved creating it.</p>

<p>This follows a reaffirmation of commitment from the government towards tech start-ups, with Prime Minister David Cameron stating the other day:</p>

<p>“British SMEs are already doing incredible things, but we urgently need more of them to follow that boldness. We need this to be a country where more people think ‘I can start my own business and I can sell to the world.</p>
