<h3>10. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS</h3>
<p>Intellectual Property Rights to the Websites
We own the intellectual property rights to the design of and the information on the Websites, including the name of the Websites and the look and feel of the color combinations, button shapes, and other graphical elements of the Websites. Such intellectual property is protected by international treaties and by copyright, trademark, patent, and trade-secret laws, as well as other proprietary rights. For example, we own a copyright on the selection, organization, arrangement, and enhancement of the Websites, as well as on our original content on the Websites.
Intellectual Property Rights to the Games
We own the intellectual property rights to a large number of the games on the Websites, and for certain games, we requested and obtained permission from the copyright holders known to us. For some games, we could not find any copyright information, or, due to general use on the Internet, this information can no longer be obtained. Some games may be used under special conditions, considering a number of prerequisite constraints. These prerequisite constraints are, as far as we could determine, met by Whackacake. We do not change anything in the source code of the games. For example, credit holders, brand names, or references to websites remain unchanged</p>

<h3>11. CLAIMS FOR INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h3>
<p>If, in your view, any copyright or other intellectual property right ("IP right") that you may have is being infringed by/on the Websites, please inform us immediately, thereby providing us with:</p>
<ol>
	<li>the electronic or physical signature of the owner of the IP right or the person authorized to act on the owner's behalf;</li>
  <li>a description of the IP right that you claim has been infringed, and a description of the infringing activity;</li>
  <li>the identification of the location where the original or authorized copy of the copyrighted work exists (for example, the URL of the websites where it is posted, or the name of the book in which it has been published, or, in case of a registered brand name, an excerpt of such register evidencing the registry);</li>
  <li>a copy of a license in which you are granted the right to use and to protect such IP right (if you are not the owner of the IP right);</li>
  <li>the identification of the URL or other specific location on this site where the material that you claim is infringing is located; this information must be specific enough to enable us to locate such material;</li>
  <li>your name and full contact details; and</li>
  <li>a statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>
</ol>

<h3>12. THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT SERVICE PROVIDERS</h3>
<p>Whackacake is able to sell you, either directly or through the third-party payment service providers (PSPs) that supply payment transaction services to Whackacake and the users of the Websites in order to facilitate the sale of products and services through the Websites, virtual items (such as a virtual game element or virtual coins) or a subscription to download a game. If you purchase something from the Websites, you will enter into an agreement with either Whackacake or the relevant PSP to carry out the payment (you will see this on the payment screen).</p>
<p>Via PSP. If the agreement is entered into with a PSP, Whackacake will never be responsible for the communication between you and the PSP, and all information that you exchange with the PSP will be subject exclusively to the privacy policy and/or other regulations of that PSP. You must indemnify Whackacake against reclaimed payments or other claims the PSP may have as a consequence of the non-performance of payment.</p>
<p>Via Whackacake. All information that we receive from you in the context of performing payments and supplying services are subject to Whackacake's privacy policy. Our privacy policy can be found . You agree to pay all applicable taxes and costs associated with your purchase.</p>
<p>If you purchase a product or service from us in the EU, you will have seven calendar days to cancel your purchase (the "cooling off" period), starting on the first day after the date of delivery or purchase. The date of purchase will be considered the date of delivery. You do not have this right if the service or product has been delivered and used before the cooling off period ends. If you purchase virtual items, you will have no right to cancel your purchase because our performance commences upon supply.</p>
<p>Whackacake does not issue refunds for any reason whatsoever. You will not receive a refund or other compensation for unused virtual items. If you cancel or close your account (whether voluntarily or involuntarily), the virtual items you have purchased will be forfeit and Whackacake will provide you with no compensation whatsoever in this regard.</p>

<h3>13. THIRD-PARTY SITES & ADVERTISERS</h3>
<p>The Websites may include links to third party websites, including links provided as automated search results. Some of these sites may contain materials that are objectionable, unlawful, or inaccurate. The existence links do not mean that we endorse these third-party sites or services. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible or liable for any content or other materials on these third-party sites. Any dealings that you have with advertisers found on the Websites are between you and the advertiser, and you acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for any loss or claim you may have against any advertiser.</p>

<h3>14. USE OF SOFTWARE</h3>
<p>We may make software available for you to download or use. Such software will be subject to the terms of the license agreement that accompanies it. If there is no license agreement presented to you with the software, then the following license, in addition to the other terms of these Terms of Use, shall govern your use of such software. We grant you a personal, nonexclusive, non transferable, limited license to install the software on any single computer. The software is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties and is owned by us or our suppliers. You may not sell or redistribute the software. You may not incorporate it or any portion of it into another product. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software or otherwise attempt to derive the source code (except where expressly permitted by law). You may not modify, adapt, or create derivative works from the software in any way or remove proprietary notices in the software. You agree to abide by all laws and regulations regarding your use of the software. You may not authorize or assist any third party to do any of the things prohibited in this paragraph.</p>
<p>We may automatically check your version of the software and update it to improve its performance and capabilities. If you shut down the software during an automatic update or otherwise interfere with the installation of the update, the software may be damaged and/or cease to operate.
You agree to fully comply with all import and export laws, regulations, rules, and orders of the Netherlands or any other foreign (e.g., the United States) government agency or authority, and you agree not to directly or indirectly export, reexport, transfer, and/or release the software, related technology, or any product thereof for any proscribed end-use or to any proscribed country, entity, or person (wherever located) without proper governmental authorization. You bear full responsibility for and assume all expenses relating to your compliance with the described laws, regulations, rules, and orders and for obtaining all necessary authorizations and clearances. You further agree to assume responsibility for and bear all expenses relating to your compliance with the described laws, regulations, rules, and orders, and for obtaining all necessary authorizations and clearances.</p>

<h3>15. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
<p>We provide the Websites as is, with all faults and as available. We and our suppliers make no express warranties or guarantees about the Websites. Whackacake is not obligated to supply any support whatsoever. To the extent permitted by law, we and our suppliers disclaim implied warranties that the Websites and all software, content, and services distributed through the Websites are merchantable, of satisfactory quality, accurate, timely, fit for a particular purpose or need, and non infringing. We do not guarantee that the Websites will meet your requirements or will be error-free, reliable, without interruption, or available at all times. We do not guarantee that the results that may be obtained from the use of the Websites (including any support services) will be effective, reliable, or accurate or will meet your requirements. We do not guarantee that you will be able to access or use the Websites (either directly or through third-party networks) at times or locations of your choosing. No oral or written information or advice given by a representative of Whackacake shall create a warranty. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws that this contract cannot change.</p>

<h3>16. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
<p>Your sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute with us is to discontinue your use of the Websites. In no event shall our liability (or the liability of our parent company or our suppliers) for any and all claims relating to the use of the Websites exceed the total amount of service fees that you paid us during a one-year period for the specific service at issue. We, our parent, our content partners, and our suppliers shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or exemplary damages arising from your use of, inability to use, or reliance upon the Websites. These exclusions apply to any claims for lost profits, lost data, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any other commercial damages or losses, even if we knew or should have known of the possibility of such damages. Because some countries, states, or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such countries, states, or jurisdictions, our liability (and the liability of our parent and suppliers) shall be limited to the extent permitted by law.</p>

<h3>17. INDEMNIFICATION</h3>
<p>Upon a request by us, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us and our parent and other affiliated companies as well as any respective employees, contractors, officers, directors, and agents from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including attorney's fees that arise from your use or misuse of the Websites. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defence and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with us in asserting any available defences.</p>

<h3>18. INTERNATIONAL USE</h3>
<p>We make no representation that any content of the Websites is appropriate or available for use in locations outside the Netherlands. Accessing the Websites from territories where the content is illegal is prohibited. If you choose to access the Websites from a location outside the Netherlands, you do so on your own initiative and you are responsible for compliance with local laws.</p>

<h3>19. CHOICE OF LAW AND LOCATION FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES</h3>
<p>You agree that the laws of the Netherlands govern this contract and any claim or dispute that you may have against us, without regard to Dutch conflict of laws rules, and that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall have no applicability. You further agree that any disputes or claims that you may have against us will be resolved by a court located in the Netherlands, and you agree and submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim or action.</p>
<p>Please note that by agreeing to these Terms of Use, you are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>waiving claims that you might otherwise have against us, based on the laws of other jurisdictions, including your own;</li>
  <li>irrevocably consenting to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in, courts in the Netherlands over any disputes or claims you have with us; and</li>
  <li>submitting yourself to the personal jurisdiction of courts located in the Netherlands for the purpose of resolving any such disputes or claims.</li>
</ol>

<h3>20. SEVERABILITY &amp; INTEGRATION</h3>
<p>This contract and any supplemental terms, policies, rules, and guidelines posted on the Websites constitute the entire agreement between you and us and supersede all previous written or oral agreements. If any part of these Terms of Use is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

<h3>21. TERMINATION</h3>
<p>Your right to use the Websites automatically terminates if you violate these Terms of Use or any rules or guidelines posted in connection with the Websites. We also reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to terminate your access to all or part of the Websites, for any reason, with or without notice. </p>
